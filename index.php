                    <p>I am currently studying Application Developer at Scalda in Vlissingen. Before this I studied HBO-ICT at
                        the HZ university, but I didn't meet the
                        requirements to pass on to the next year. Despite all that, I'd say that I have found my passion in
                        programming and am surely planning on continuing this.</p>

                        do sports though. I am the goalkeeper for my
                        local waterpolo team, and I absolutely love to go windsurfing in the summer.</p>

            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>Ever since I started programming I have offcourse done a couple of projects. Some I am defenitely more
                proud of than others, but I'll list a few here.
                The headers will be links aswell as titles to the after mentioned projects. Some of projects will be
                dutch. All of the repositories of these projects
                can be found on my github which is linked above and below.
            </p>

            <li>
                <h2><a style="color:white" href="https://sleepy-harbor-96591.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">original portfolio</a></h2>
                <div class="pageList">
                    <div class="pageText">
                        <p>As the first project I am listing here, you would probably think that this is the project that
                            I'm most proud of. But that is not the case here.
                            This project was my first ever github project. This project was meant as a portfolio assignement
                            when I was still studying at the HZ university.
                            For how much experience I had when I started this project, I think that it is a pretty good
                            website. The website is currently in all kinds of disrepair,
                            and is defenitely not a good website in it's current state, but I am still proud of what i
                            achived with only 1 or 2 months of any coding experience.

                        <p>This one is another project I made for an assignement at the HZ university. This was a group
                            project that we had to make for a primary school.
                            It had to be some kind of small game that had to do with a specific course they taught at
                            that school. We chose history. The whole game is written in typescript
                            and is made in such a way that you never have to reload the page. You can even save your
                            progress if you don't delete your cookies.
                            This is a project that I am personally very proud of. Yes the website is still riddled with
                            bugs and quirks that need to be ironed out, but I think
                            it's a small fun little game that we made in about 4 or 6 weeks.

                        <p>So this very website you're in right now is also a school assignement, but this one is a school
                            assignement for my current school, Scalda.
                            I will be keeping this website up to date with new projects and thing I'm learning, so everyone
                            who's interested can take a peek.
